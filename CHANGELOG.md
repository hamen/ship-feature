# Changelog

All notable changes to **ship-feature** are documented here. This project follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`antigravity`/`gemini` is now a read-only reviewer in `ship-feature plan-review`.** It runs the
  `gemini` CLI in its default non-interactive mode — which already excludes the `shell`, `edit`,
  `write_file`, and `web_fetch` tools — with `-e none` to disable extensions. `--approval-mode plan` is
  **not** used: in gemini-cli v0.26.0 it throws unless `experimental.plan` is enabled, and default mode
  gives the same tool exclusions. The reviewer names `antigravity`, `agy`, and `gemini` are aliases that
  collapse to a single Gemini run.
- **`SHIP_FEATURE_GEMINI_MODEL`** (env or config) pins the model for that reviewer. Default
  `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, because the CLI's own built-in default is a retired model that 404s.

### Changed

- **`agy` is no longer relay-only in `plan-review`.** It (and `gemini`) now alias the read-only
  `antigravity` reviewer above. Only `opencode` remains relay-only. **Behavior change:** a panel that
  lists `antigravity` now **requires** the `gemini` CLI at the plan gate — where it used to be skipped
  with a warning, a missing `gemini` binary now **fails the quorum** (exit `3`), so a review can't
  silently pass on a thinned panel.

### Notes

- The `antigravity` name maps to two different binaries by command: the `gemini` CLI in `plan-review`
  (the only Gemini binary with a read-only mode) and `agy` in `relay` (unchanged). The gemini read-only
  guarantee is slightly weaker than claude/qwen `--safe-mode`: it disables extensions but cannot block a
  checkout's `.gemini/` hooks or MCP servers, so run the plan gate from a trusted checkout.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added

- **`ship-feature plan-review`** — step 2 as a first-class command. It fans an implementation plan (a file
  argument, stdin, or `./plan.md`) out to a panel of agents for a **read-only** review and prints each
  review to the terminal; nothing is written or posted. The panel defaults to `SHIP_FEATURE_PLAN_REVIEWERS`
  (a plan gate often wants a smaller panel than the PR cross-review), falling back to
  `SHIP_FEATURE_REVIEWERS`, and is overridable with `--reviewers`; `--parallel` runs them concurrently.
  Fail-closed exit codes
  mirror the relay: `0` every reviewer responded, `3` a reviewer failed/timed out/returned empty (a
  supported reviewer from the panel whose CLI is missing also fails — the panel is the quorum), `1` usage
  error.
  - **Read-only is enforced, not just asked.** Supported reviewers are only those that can be constrained:
    `claude --permission-mode plan --safe-mode` (safe-mode also stops checkout hooks/plugins/MCP loading),
    `codex --sandbox read-only`, `cursor --mode=ask` (Q&A),
    `qwen --approval-mode plan` (qwen's read-only mode — denies edit/write/shell) plus `--safe-mode` (which
    also blocks any checkout config/hooks/MCP from executing). Each flag is guarded by an argv-contract
    test that also asserts qwen never uses the auto-approving `yolo` mode. `agy` and `opencode` are **relay-only** and
    skipped with a warning — `agy` has no read-only mode (its relay flag disables all permissions) and
    `opencode` needs the file-attach path — so the "nothing is written" guarantee holds for everything
    that runs.
  - Portable `timeout` (falls back to `gtimeout`, then runs without a limit on stock macOS); the reviewer
    list is not glob-expanded; `--reviewers` with no value / an empty value / a following flag is a clean
    usage error; a file after `--` or `-` (stdin) is honored; an empty stdin pipe falls back to
    `./plan.md`; a zero timeout is rejected. Timeout via `SHIP_FEATURE_PLAN_TIMEOUT` (default 300s).
  - `^C` during `--parallel` tears the reviewers down: an interrupt kills each backgrounded reviewer's
    whole descendant tree (subshell → `$()` → `timeout` → agent) by walking PPIDs — a plain group-kill
    would miss the agent because `timeout` re-groups its child — so it stops burning credits instead of
    orphaning the agents. Covered by a regression test.

  This makes "review the plan with codex and qwen" a single command.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-16

First release.

### Added

- **`WORKFLOW.md`** — the canonical gated pipeline (plan → plan-review → 🚦 human gate → worktree + PR →
  cross-review → 🚦 human merge → verify), including the semantic definition of the human gates, the
  loop-termination rule (iterate while any Blocker/Should-fix exists; stop only at full agreement or
  Nits-only), the exact-SHA rule, an explicit-reviewer quorum, and the `--light` path.
- **`bin/ship-feature`** — a small Bash 3.2-safe CLI: `preflight` (assert a feature worktree branched off
  `origin/HEAD`, marker git-excluded, ancestry) and `relay` (a transparent pass-through to
  `pr-review-relay` that preserves stdout and the exact exit code).
- **Adapters** — one workflow skill in `~/.agents/skills/` used across tools, plus a Cursor rule and a
  marked block for `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. Each only points at `WORKFLOW.md`; no duplicated logic.
- **`install.sh`** — idempotent, atomic installer that backs up any global file it modifies, checks
  `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`, and smoke-tests that every adapter resolves.
- **Privacy guards** — `scripts/scan-generic.sh` (deny-list-free email/home-path scan for CI, works on
  fork PRs) and `scripts/scan-personal-data.sh` (local pre-publication scan of full history, commit
  metadata, filenames, and ref names against a private deny-list file that is never `source`-d).
- **Tests + CI** — `test/test-ship-feature.sh` (real temp repos + stubbed `pr-review-relay`) and a
  GitHub Actions matrix on Ubuntu + macOS that checks out the PR head SHA, runs the suite, `scan-generic.sh`,
  and gitleaks. (`scan-personal-data.sh` needs a private deny-list, so it runs locally pre-publication,
  not in CI.)
